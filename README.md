# GAN-generating new images
1.Creating dataset, in this first case i have took only one class that is car images and trained the generator and discriminator.
2.Dataset preprocessing for creating a set of images with same size.
3.Installing all the dependencies.
4.Creating a generator class and discriminator class.
5.Choosing the optimizers, learning rate and loss functions for training.
6. Training GAN.
7. Displaying new images created.
8. Plotting the loss of generator and discriminator.
